Qno5.Define Favicon and give an illustrative example?
Ans :A favicon is a small, 16x16 pixel icon used on web browsers to represent a website or a web page.
     Short for “favorite icon,” favicons are commonly displayed on tabs at the top of a web browser, 
     but they're also found on your browser's bookmark bar, history and in search results, alongside
     the page url.
	Example:-
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
		<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		<title>BookWorld - Your Online Bookstore</title>
		<!-- Favicon -->
		<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
		</head>
		<body>
		</body> 
		</html>
